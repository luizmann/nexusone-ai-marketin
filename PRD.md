## Design Direction

The design should feel sophisticated and trustworthy like enterprise software, yet approachable enough for small business owners - think Stripe's clarity meets Notion's warmth. Minimal interface that emphasizes content and data over decorative elements, allowing the user's campaigns and results to be the visual focus.

## Color Selection

Complementary (opposite colors) - Deep navy primary with warm orange accents creates professional trustworthiness while the energetic orange drives action and optimism about marketing results.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Navy (oklch(0.25 0.08 250)) - Conveys trust, stability, and professional expertise
- **Secondary Colors**: Light Gray (oklch(0.95 0.02 250)) for backgrounds, Medium Gray (oklch(0.70 0.04 250)) for subtle elements
- **Accent Color**: Warm Orange (oklch(0.70 0.15 50)) - Energetic call-to-action color that encourages engagement and conversions
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background Light Gray (oklch(0.97 0.02 250)): Dark Navy text (oklch(0.25 0.08 250)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Primary Navy (oklch(0.25 0.08 250)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 12.1:1 ✓
  - Accent Orange (oklch(0.70 0.15 50)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓
  - Card backgrounds (oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Navy text (oklch(0.25 0.08 250)) - Ratio 12.1:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey modern professionalism with excellent readability across data-heavy interfaces - Inter provides the perfect balance of technical clarity and human warmth for both headlines and detailed content.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Page Titles): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal letter spacing  
  - H3 (Card Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal letter spacing
  - Body Text: Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height (1.6)
  - Small Text: Inter Regular/14px/normal line height
  - Buttons: Inter Medium/16px/wide letter spacing

## Animations

Subtle and purposeful animations that enhance understanding of system state changes and guide user attention to important updates - avoiding flashy effects that could undermine the professional atmosphere.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Quick micro-interactions (100-200ms) reinforce the responsive, high-performance nature of the platform while gentle transitions (300ms) between states maintain context
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Credit balance changes, notification badges, and campaign status updates deserve subtle animation focus; navigation and loading states should be smooth but understated

- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons with filled variants for active states, outline for inactive - emphasizing clarity over personality
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4px grid system using Tailwind's spacing scale (p-4, p-6, p-8 for progressively larger containers)
